# Anki_Automation_Add_on
Automatically generate high-quality Anki flashcards using GPT and add them directly to Anki — a spaced-repetition flashcard app for effective learning.
🚀 GPT → Anki Flashcard Automation

This project automates the process of creating structured, high-quality Anki flashcards using GPT and adding them directly to Anki via AnkiConnect.

It is designed for practical, logic-heavy learning domains such as:

LeetCode & DSA problem solving

AI/ML Roadmaps

Programming languages (Python, C++, SQL, etc.)

System design & computer science fundamentals

Instead of manually creating cards, this tool extracts flashcard-ready content from GPT responses and automatically organizes them into hierarchical Anki decks.
